# Custom partition table for RiVitaflow
# Columns: name,type,subtype,offset,size,flags
#
# NOTES:
# - This file creates a data partition labeled "storage" which the firmware
#   mounts as a SPIFFS filesystem at runtime (/spiffs). Adjust sizes/offsets to
#   match your flash size. The label must be "storage" (or change the code
#   to match another label).
# - The offsets/sizes below are typical starting values for a 4MB flash.
#   If your target flash is smaller (eg 2MB) reduce the storage size accordingly.

# Name,   Type, SubType, Offset,   Size, Flags
